# PipAssimp

Fork of [PyAssimp](https://pypi.org/project/pyassimp/) that includes a minified build of the the [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) library. This is still a large package (~68mb), but half the size of the full assimp build. Also working model can be installed from requirments.txt, which saves some hassle on continous pipelines.


#### Installation
```  sh
$ pip install PipAssimp
```
